# CLAW Sandbox Creation for Beginners

This document will explain, in the simplest step-by-step possible, how to take a computer from "unwanted box in the corner with no operating system" to working Islandora CLAW sandbox.

## Terminology:
Some terminology you may need to understand to follow this step-by-step document:

Sandbox (n.)--a copy of a software environment that you can "play in"; usually means a version that can be easily created, 
messed up, and wiped clean again
Terminal (n.)--a command-line interface for your computer. This is the fancy/scary looking interface that sometimes has 
colorful text on a black background. Terminals provide more control than a GUI when making the kinds of advanced changes to
a computer system that are required for software like the pre-requisite requirements for Islandora.
Requirement (n.)--software/hardware basics that must be in place before a piece of software will run properly
GUI (n.)-- a graphical user interface. This is the "pretty" front end designed for end-users.

### Step-by-step:
#### Step one

Find the computer you want to use for your Islandora sandbox. It does not have to have an operating system (like Windows),
but if it does, that's not a problem. It should be a machine that has been totally wiped or only has files that can be deleted. If you have any files on it that you would like to save, you should back them up elsewhere. 

  Other requirements this computer will (ideally) meet:
  1. 3GB of RAM
  2. 4GB of hard drive memory free (25 GB required for Ubuntu desktop)?
  3. Internet connection
  
  >If you're not sure how much RAM and free memory on your hard drive is on the computer and you have a Windows computer, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000149.htm).

  >If you don't have an operating system running, you can try to install the Ubuntu operating system below and follow these [steps](**return here to include link**)

#### Step two

On another computer, insert an empty CD or USB drive with at least 2GB of space. Follow [these instructions](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0) for creating a bootable drive with Ubuntu.

#### Step three

On the Islandora sanbox computer, follow these [instructions](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#0).

#### Step four

Open the terminal of your new Ubuntu computer.
